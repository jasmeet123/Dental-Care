            "Use of the Mobile App Dental Care, Inc. (“Dental Care”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) operates the iOS and Android mobile applications and website located at www.DentalCareApp.com and other related applications with links to these Terms of Use (collectively, the “Mobile App”). We offer online telehealth services (the “Services”) enabling our members (“Members”) to report their health history and engage healthcare professionals (“Treating Providers”) to obtain dental and healthcare services (“Services”). By accessing and using the Mobile App / mobile application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and all other terms and policies that appear on the Mobile App. If you do not wish to be bound by any of these Terms of Use you may not use the Mobile App or the Services.\n" +
            "Healthcare Services. All of the Treating Providers who deliver Services through Dental Care are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you. Neither Dental Care nor any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Service shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Treating Provider via the Services.\n" +
            "Mobile App Content. None of the Mobile App content should be considered medical advice or an endorsement, representation or warranty that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate, or effective for you.\n" +
            "Informed Consent:\n" +
            "A. Telehealth is the delivery of dental services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the dental professional are not in the same physical location. During your telehealth consultation with a Treating Provider, details of your health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology, and your Treating Provider may perform a physical examination through these technologies.\n" +
            "B. The telehealth Services you receive from Treating Providers are not intended to replace a primary care Dental relationship or be your permanent medical home. However, your initial visit with a Treating Provider will begin as a consultation (e.g. to determine the most appropriate treatment setting for you to receive care) and will not necessarily give rise to an ongoing treatment relationship. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Treating Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care Dental and other healthcare professionals as recommended. We may make arrangements for follow-up care either through Dental Care or other healthcare providers. Among the benefits of our Services are improved access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with any health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:\n" +
            "In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate dental decision making by the Treating Provider;\n" +
            "Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted by phone or other means of communication.\n" +
            "In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;\n" +
            "Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, in rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information.\n" +
            "C. By accepting these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following:\n" +
            "You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.\n" +
            "If your health insurance coverage does not include or is not sufficient to satisfy the Services charges in full, you may be fully responsible for payment.\n" +
            "Your treating provider may determine that the Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide telehealth services to you through the Mobile App.\n" +
            "D. You can send messages to your Treating Provider by contacting Dental Care Customer Support. Emails or electronic messages to Customer Support or your Treating Provider may not be returned immediately. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.\n" +
            "E. You may also be able to send written notes to therapists or other Treating Providers or to Customer Support using a secure messaging portal within the Mobile App (the “Messaging Portal”). Messages you send over the Messaging Portal may be viewed by more than one Treating Provider or Customer Support agent and will typically be answered within 48 hours. You should not rely on the Messaging Portal if you need immediate attention from a Treating Provider or other dental professional. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. You understand and agree that messaging with Treating Providers over the Messaging Portal does not give rise to a provider-patient relationship, and does not by itself constitute treatment, diagnosis, therapy, or medical advice.\n" +
            "Privacy: The information you provide to your Treating Provider during a medical consultation or therapy session is confidential, except for certain legal exceptions as more fully described in our Notice of Privacy Practices. We devote considerable effort toward ensuring that your personal information is secure. Information regarding our use of health and other personal information is provided in our Site Privacy Policy and health information Notice of Privacy Practices. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as appointment reminders, service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account. While secure electronic messaging is always preferred to insecure email, under certain circumstances, insecure email communication containing personal health information may take place between you and Dental Care. Dental Care cannot ensure the security or confidentiality of messages sent by email. Information relating to your care, including clinical notes and medical records, are stored on secure servers maintained by Dental Care.\n" +
            "User Accounts. When you register on the site or mobile application, you are required to create an account (“Account”) by entering your name, email address, password and certain other information collected by Dental Care (collectively “Account Information”). To create an Account, you must be of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract, you may not register to use our Services. You agree that the Account Information that you provide to us at all times, including during registration and in any information you upload to the Site/Mobile Application will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You may not transfer or share your Account password with anyone, or create more than one Account (with the exception of subaccounts established for children of whom you are the parent or legal guardian).

Dental Care reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable, regarding the security of the Site/Mobile Application and your Account Information.

You may not use anyone else's account at any time.\n" +
            "Use of the Services by Children. The Services are available for use by children, but the Member for all patients under the age of 18 must be the patient’s parent or legal guardian. If you register as the parent or legal guardian on behalf of a minor, you will be fully responsible for complying with these Terms of Use.\n" +
            "Access Rights. We hereby grant to you a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable right to access the Mobile App and use the Services solely for your personal non-commercial use and only as permitted under these Terms of Use and any separate agreements you may have entered into with us (“Access Rights”). We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to deny or suspend use of the Mobile App or Services to anyone for any reason.

We also recommend that you do not store your Account password through your web browser or other software.\n" +
            "Fees and Purchase Terms. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. By providing Dental Care with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that Dental Care is authorized to immediately invoice your account for all fees and charges due and payable to Dental Care hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. If your health plan, employer or agency has arranged with Dental Care to pay the fee or any portion of the fee, or if the fee is pursuant to some other arrangement with Dental Care, that fee adjustment will be reflected in the fee that you are ultimately charged. Please check with your employer, health plan or agency to determine if any Services will be reimbursed.\n" +
            "If you do not have insurance coverage for Services, or if your coverage is denied, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be personally responsible for all incurred expenses. Dental Care offers no guarantee that you shall receive any such reimbursement. Dental Care reserves the right to modify or implement a new pricing structure at any time prior to billing you for your initial payment or for future payments due pursuant to these Terms of Use. You understand and agree that for Services provided on an appointment basis, you will be responsible for a missed appointment fee equal to the fees you and your insurer or other payor would have paid for the scheduled services if you do not cancel a scheduled appointment at least 24 hours in advance.\n" +
            "Website Links: We will not be liable for any information, software, or links found at any other website, internet location, or source of information, nor for your use of such information, software or links nor for the acts or omissions of any such websites or their respective operations. \n" +

            "Right to modify. We may at our sole discretion change, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time on a going-forward basis. Continued use of the Mobile App and/or Services following notice of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms of Use, inclusive of such changes.\n" +
            "DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE MOBILE APP OR SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BOTH THE MOBILE APP AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS.
